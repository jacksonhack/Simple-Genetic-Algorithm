How to run my SGA programs

- They are written in java
- No additional libraries are required (beyond the standard java libraries)
- They live in their respective folders (maxones and rosenbrock)
- They can be compiled as one would normally compile a java program:
    - Pre-requisites: ensure that you have java installed on your machine (JDK)
    - From the command line (within the folder of the program you want to run), type:
        - javac *.java (e.g. javac maxones_SGA.java)
        - java [name of the main class] (e.g. java maxones_SGA)
        - the output will be written to a file called "output.txt"

    - alternatively, you can use an IDE such as VSCode to compile and run the program
        using their extensions or plugins
